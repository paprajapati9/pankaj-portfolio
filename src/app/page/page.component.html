    <p class="pp-intro-description">I started working as a python developer
      while learning scraping and Machine Learning, while learning this I built my
      first project around web scraping 
      and later built the movie recommendation model project. With this I got my 1st intern
      where I worked on building a machine learning model for operation asha based 
      on a clustering problem and started learnning R for data analysis.<br><br>
      I then started learning JavaScript and Node JS to convert a project I did in R
      to a web application.
