    <p class="pp-intro-description">Since the time I started as a
      python developer I have come a long way as I worked with a lot of
      different technologies and frameworks which makes a wide spectrum.<br><br>
      I have been very <span class="pp-primary-400">passionate</span> about
      <span class="pp-primary-400">Software Development</span> as a whole and
      am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.<br><br>
      Working in a company and open source organization have made me interact
      and learm from a lot of different people across the globe.<br><br>
      As a lot of work I have done has been related to 
      <span class="pp-primary-400">Web Development, Machine Learning and DataScience</span>, these
      are the major areas I have knowledge in but I have
      never tried to limit myself to one particular technology and always tried to
      learn new things as they come up.<br><br>
